✦ The Game We're In ✦
If they told me to choose, I’d choose
That wellness of knowing how sick we are,
The bliss of unhappiness.

If they told me to choose, I’d choose
The innocence of not being innocent,
The purity I wallow in for my sins.

If they told me to choose, I’d choose
The very love I hate with,
This hope feeding on desperate loaves.  
What’s happening here, gentlemen,
Is that I’m playing the game of death.
